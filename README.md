Repository for the project: Automated Machine Learning for Satellite Data:Integrating remote sensing pre-trained modelsinto AutoML systems

The structure of this repository is the following:

-Autokeras-rs: Auto-Keras version with a new remote sensing block and a task specific 'SatelliteImageClassifier'

-Datasets: Folder with scripts to add the Brazilian datasets to 'tensorflow-datasets'

-Experiments

-Results


The 13-channel pre-trained models can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l7j9591teap0xvm/AAAvTffeTZV2j9wXP3rWzhgea?dl=0
